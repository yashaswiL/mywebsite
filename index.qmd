## Hi! I am a first-year Ph.D. student of Public Administration at the department of Public Policy, Analysis and Management at CUPPA, UIC. With a master's degree in applied economics, I aim to contribute innovative solutions to contemporary public administration challenges and emerge as a scholar looking to make a positive impact on society through collaboration with peers and faculty and dissemination of research findings.
